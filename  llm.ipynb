      "{\"model\":\"llama3:8b\",\"created_at\":\"2024-04-29T18:24:40.570302516Z\",\"response\":\"What a great question!\\n\\nThe short answer is: scattering of light by tiny molecules in the atmosphere.\\n\\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\\n\\nWhen sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so they scatter the light in all directions. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\\n\\nNow, here's the important part: shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering the shorter wavelengths. Think of it like a game of pool: the smaller balls (blue light) bounce around more easily than the larger ones (red light).\\n\\nAs a result, our eyes perceive the blue light as being scattered in all directions, giving the sky its blue appearance. The color we see is actually the combined effect of the scattered blue light and the direct sunlight that reaches our eyes.\\n\\nOther factors can influence the apparent color of the sky, such as:\\n\\n1. Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor can scatter light in different ways, changing the sky's color.\\n2. Time of day: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, scattering more blue light and making the sky appear more red or orange.\\n3. Altitude and atmospheric pressure: At higher altitudes or with lower atmospheric pressure, the air is thinner, and the sky can appear more intense blue.\\n\\nSo, there you have it! The blue color of the sky is a result of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in our atmosphere.\",\"done\":true,\"context\":[128006,882,128007,198,198,35734,374,279,13180,6437,949,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,2294,3488,4999,198,791,2875,4320,374,25,72916,315,3177,555,13987,35715,304,279,16975,627,198,8586,596,264,810,11944,16540,512,198,4599,40120,29933,9420,596,16975,11,433,35006,13987,35715,315,45612,1093,47503,320,45,17,8,323,24463,320,46,17,570,4314,35715,527,1790,9333,1109,279,46406,315,9621,3177,11,779,814,45577,279,3177,304,682,18445,13,1115,374,3967,439,13558,64069,72916,11,7086,1306,279,8013,83323,10425,13558,64069,11,889,1176,7633,279,25885,304,279,3389,220,777,339,9478,627,198,7184,11,1618,596,279,3062,961,25,24210,320,12481,8,93959,527,38067,810,1109,5129,320,1171,8,93959,13,1115,374,1606,279,9333,35715,527,810,7524,520,72916,279,24210,93959,13,21834,315,433,1093,264,1847,315,7463,25,279,9333,20953,320,12481,3177,8,34782,2212,810,6847,1109,279,8294,6305,320,1171,3177,570,198,198,2170,264,1121,11,1057,6548,45493,279,6437,3177,439,1694,38067,304,682,18445,11,7231,279,13180,1202,6437,11341,13,578,1933,584,1518,374,3604,279,11093,2515,315,279,38067,6437,3177,323,279,2167,40120,430,25501,1057,6548,627,198,11663,9547,649,10383,279,10186,1933,315,279,13180,11,1778,439,512,198,16,13,87597,4787,25,33093,11,25793,11,323,3090,38752,649,45577,3177,304,2204,5627,11,10223,279,13180,596,1933,13,198,17,13,4212,315,1938,25,12220,64919,323,44084,11,279,7160,596,45220,617,311,5944,5129,27650,1555,279,16975,11,72916,810,6437,3177,323,3339,279,13180,5101,810,2579,477,19087,13,198,18,13,24610,3993,323,45475,7410,25,2468,5190,4902,21237,477,449,4827,45475,7410,11,279,3805,374,65355,11,323,279,13180,649,5101,810,19428,6437,627,198,4516,11,1070,499,617,433,0,578,6437,1933,315,279,13180,374,264,1121,315,279,72916,315,40120,555,13987,35715,304,1057,16975,13,128009],\"total_duration\":18667963631,\"load_duration\":9928129715,\"prompt_eval_count\":16,\"prompt_eval_duration\":92206000,\"eval_count\":354,\"eval_duration\":8603390000}"

However, when things go wrong (an unexpected end result, infinite agent loop, slower than expected execution, higher than expected token usage), it’s extremely helpful to debug by looking through the application traces. LangSmith gives clear visibility and debugging information at each step of an LLM sequence, making it much easier to identify and root-cause issues.\\nWe provide native rendering of chat messages, functions, and retrieve documents.Initial Test Set\\u200bWhile many developers still ship an initial version of their application based on “vibe checks”, we’ve seen an increasing number of engineering teams start to adopt a more test driven approach. LangSmith allows developers to create datasets, which are collections of inputs and reference outputs, and use these to run tests on their LLM applications.\\nThese test cases can be uploaded in bulk, created on the fly, or exported from application traces. LangSmith also makes it easy to run custom evaluations (both LLM and heuristic based) to score test results.Comparison View\\u200bWhen prototyping different versions of your applications and making changes, it’s important to see whether or not you’ve regressed with respect to your initial test cases.\\nOftentimes, changes in the prompt, retrieval strategy, or model choice can have huge implications in responses produced by your application.\\nIn order to get a sense for which variant is performing better, it’s useful to be able to view results for different configurations on the same datapoints side-by-side.

      "                   Document(page_content=\"Every playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.Beta Testing\\u200bBeta testing allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, it’s important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it’s breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow. This will help in curation of test cases that can help track regressions/improvements and development of automatic evaluations.Capturing Feedback\\u200bWhen launching your application to an initial set of users, it’s important to gather human feedback on the responses it’s producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score. A common workflow is to filter on traces that receive a poor user feedback score, then drill down into problematic points using the detailed trace view.Annotating Traces\\u200bLangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.Adding Runs to a Dataset\\u200bAs your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios. This is a key benefit in having your logging system and your evaluation/testing system in the same platform.Production\\u200bClosely inspecting key data points, growing benchmarking datasets, annotating traces, and drilling down into important data in trace view are workflows you’ll also want to do once your app hits production.However, especially at the production stage, it’s crucial to get a high-level overview of application performance with respect to latency, cost, and feedback scores. This ensures that it's delivering desirable results at scale.Online evaluations and automations allow you to process and score production traces in near real-time.Additionally, threads provide a seamless way to group traces from a single conversation, making it easier to track the performance of your application across multiple turns.Monitoring and A/B Testing\\u200bLangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period — this is especially handy for debugging production issues.LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.Automations\\u200bAutomations are a powerful feature in LangSmith that allow you to perform actions on traces in near real-time. This can be used to automatically score traces, send them to annotation queues, or send them to datasets.To define an automation, simply provide a filter condition, a sampling rate, and an action to perform. Automations are particularly helpful for processing traces at production scale.Threads\\u200bMany LLM applications are multi-turn, meaning that they involve a series of interactions between the user and the application.
