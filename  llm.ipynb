      "{\"model\":\"llama3:8b\",\"created_at\":\"2024-05-03T21:44:45.32952837Z\",\"response\":\"What a great question!\\n\\nThe short answer is: scattering.\\n\\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\\n\\nWhen sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they scatter the shorter wavelengths of light more efficiently. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\\n\\nThe shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is because the smaller molecules are better at interacting with the shorter wavelengths. As a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance.\\n\\nHere's a rough breakdown of what happens:\\n\\n1. Sunlight enters the atmosphere, containing all the colors of the visible spectrum.\\n2. The shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered by the tiny molecules in the air.\\n3. The longer wavelengths (red and orange) continue to travel in a more direct path to our eyes, with less scattering.\\n4. Our eyes perceive the combined light as blue, because that's what we're seeing most of – the scattered blue light.\\n\\nOf course, there are some nuances to this explanation:\\n\\n* Atmospheric conditions like pollution, dust, and water vapor can affect the color of the sky by absorbing or scattering certain wavelengths of light.\\n* During sunrise and sunset, the angle of the sun and the amount of atmospheric scattering can make the sky appear more red or orange.\\n* At higher altitudes or in areas with very clean air, the sky might appear even bluer due to less scattering.\\n\\nSo, there you have it! The blue color of the sky is a result of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in our atmosphere.\",\"done\":true,\"context\":[128006,882,128007,198,198,35734,374,279,13180,6437,220,30,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,2294,3488,0,198,198,791,2875,4320,374,25,72916,13,198,198,8586,6,82,264,810,11944,16540,25,198,198,4599,40120,29933,9420,6,82,16975,11,433,35006,13987,35715,315,45612,1093,47503,220,7,45,17,8,323,24463,220,7,46,17,570,4314,35715,527,1790,9333,1109,279,46406,315,3177,11,779,814,45577,279,24210,93959,315,3177,810,30820,13,1115,374,3967,439,13558,64069,72916,11,7086,1306,279,8013,83323,10425,13558,64069,11,889,1176,7633,279,25885,304,279,3389,220,777,339,9478,13,198,198,791,24210,93959,315,3177,11,1093,6437,323,80836,11,527,38067,810,1109,279,5129,93959,11,1093,2579,323,19087,13,1115,374,1606,279,9333,35715,527,2731,520,45830,449,279,24210,93959,13,1666,264,1121,11,279,6437,3177,374,4332,6957,279,16975,11,7231,279,13180,1202,6437,11341,13,198,198,8586,6,82,264,11413,31085,315,1148,8741,25,198,198,16,13,8219,4238,29933,279,16975,11,8649,682,279,8146,315,279,9621,20326,13,198,17,13,578,24210,93959,220,7,12481,323,80836,8,527,38067,555,279,13987,35715,304,279,3805,13,198,18,13,578,5129,93959,220,7,1171,323,19087,8,3136,311,5944,304,264,810,2167,1853,311,1057,6548,11,449,2753,72916,13,198,19,13,5751,6548,45493,279,11093,3177,439,6437,11,1606,430,6,82,1148,584,6,265,9298,1455,315,220,4235,279,38067,6437,3177,13,198,198,2173,3388,11,1070,527,1063,84889,311,420,16540,25,271,9,87597,4787,1093,25793,11,16174,11,323,3090,38752,649,7958,279,1933,315,279,13180,555,70275,477,72916,3738,93959,315,3177,13,198,9,12220,64919,323,44084,11,279,9392,315,279,7160,323,279,3392,315,45475,72916,649,1304,279,13180,5101,810,2579,477,19087,13,198,9,2468,5190,4902,21237,477,304,5789,449,1633,4335,3805,11,279,13180,2643,5101,1524,1529,8977,4245,311,2753,72916,13,198,198,4516,11,1070,499,617,433,0,578,6437,1933,315,279,13180,374,264,1121,315,279,72916,315,40120,555,13987,35715,304,1057,16975,13,128009],\"total_duration\":9150944639,\"load_duration\":631570,\"prompt_eval_count\":12,\"prompt_eval_duration\":334484000,\"eval_count\":372,\"eval_duration\":8759635000}"

      "                   Document(page_content=\"Every playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.Beta Testing\\u200bBeta testing allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, it’s important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it’s breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow. This will help in curation of test cases that can help track regressions/improvements and development of automatic evaluations.Capturing Feedback\\u200bWhen launching your application to an initial set of users, it’s important to gather human feedback on the responses it’s producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score. A common workflow is to filter on traces that receive a poor user feedback score, then drill down into problematic points using the detailed trace view.Annotating Traces\\u200bLangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.Adding Runs to a Dataset\\u200bAs your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios. This is a key benefit in having your logging system and your evaluation/testing system in the same platform.Production\\u200bClosely inspecting key data points, growing benchmarking datasets, annotating traces, and drilling down into important data in trace view are workflows you’ll also want to do once your app hits production.However, especially at the production stage, it’s crucial to get a high-level overview of application performance with respect to latency, cost, and feedback scores. This ensures that it's delivering desirable results at scale.Online evaluations and automations allow you to process and score production traces in near real-time.Additionally, threads provide a seamless way to group traces from a single conversation, making it easier to track the performance of your application across multiple turns.Monitoring and A/B Testing\\u200bLangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period — this is especially handy for debugging production issues.LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.Automations\\u200bAutomations are a powerful feature in LangSmith that allow you to perform actions on traces in near real-time. This can be used to automatically score traces, send them to annotation queues, or send them to datasets.To define an automation, simply provide a filter condition, a sampling rate, and an action to perform. Automations are particularly helpful for processing traces at production scale.Threads\\u200bMany LLM applications are multi-turn, meaning that they involve a series of interactions between the user and the application.
